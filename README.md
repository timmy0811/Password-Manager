# Password-Manager
Manage all your passwords in one programm and keep it save with included encryption

The program lets you:
  * `Create` new entries including keyword, user  and password
  * `Acces` an existing entry by it's name
  * `Delete` an existing entry by it's name
  * `View` all existing entries by their names
  * `Clear` all existing entries including the save file
  * `Generate` a save password depending on user input
  
Close the programm always in the main menu to provide an all data encryption
 
When the programm is launched the first time, it will generate a random encryption key and when adding a first entry, also a savle_log file. All data you input in the programm will be saved in it and later encrypted for extra savety

When the key gets removed from directory, a new one will be created on the next start up. Don't delete key while data is encrypted.
